## 🧠 About Me

I’m a **.NET Developer** with 2+ years of hands-on experience building and optimizing enterprise web applications.  
I’m passionate about **backend development**, **WEB API architecture**, and **system performance optimization** — I love writing clean, efficient, and scalable code that drives real impact.  

Currently, I’m part of a team that develops and maintains a **Time & Expense Management System** used by thousands of employees worldwide to log hours, manage expenses, and handle payroll validations.  
Our goal is to make complex workflows seamless through thoughtful design and efficient backend engineering.

I believe in **continuous learning and technical depth** — understanding *why* something works matters to me more than just *getting it to work*.
